# Hard Problems

This folder contains **LeetCode Hard-level problems**.
They typically involve:

- Advanced algorithms (dynamic programming with optimization, segment trees, advanced graph theory).
- Complex data structures.
- Careful reasoning about edge cases and constraints.

Hard problems are meant to **push your limits** and prepare you for the toughest coding interviews.
