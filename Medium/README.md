# Medium Problems

This folder contains **LeetCode Medium-level problems**.
They usually require:

- More complex data structures (linked lists, heaps, binary trees, graphs).
- Intermediate algorithms (DFS, BFS, dynamic programming, greedy strategies).
- Careful optimization for time and space.

These problems balance difficulty and learning â€” great for improving problem-solving skills.
