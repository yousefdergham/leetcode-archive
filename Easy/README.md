# Easy Problems

This folder contains **LeetCode Easy-level problems**.
They are designed to test fundamental concepts, such as:

- Basic data structures (arrays, strings, hash maps, stacks, queues).
- Simple algorithms (two pointers, binary search, sorting basics).
- Elementary math and simulation problems.

These are good for warm-up and building confidence before moving to harder challenges.
